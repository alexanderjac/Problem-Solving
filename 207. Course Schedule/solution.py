#TC: O(E+V) , where E is the number of dependencies, V is the number of courses and d is the maximum length of acyclic paths in the graph.
		# * First of all it would take E steps to build a graph in the first step.
		# * For a single round of backtracking, in the worst case where all the nodes chained up in a line, it would take us maximum V steps to terminate the backtracking.


# * Again, follow the worst case scenario where all the nodes are chained up in a line, it would take the following:
		#one node that is in the tail would take one time
		#second node before that node would process 2 node and so one
#so it would end up getting a time complexity of âˆ‘V from 0 to V, which is V(V+1)/2
#As a result over all time complexity is O(E+V^2)

#SC: O(E+V)
	# * We built a graph data structures in the algorithm which would consume E+V space. 
` # * In addition, we employed a sort of bitmap (path) or set() to keep. track of all. visted nodes, which consumes V space.
  # * Finally since we implement the function in recursion, which would incur additional memory consumpption on call stack. In the worst case scenario all nodes are chained up in a line, the recursion would pile up V times
  # * Hence the overall space complexity of the algorithm would be O(E+ 3V) = O(E+V) 


#   Post Order DFS


#The rationale is that given a node, if the subgraph formed by all descendant nodes from this node has no cycle, then adding this node to the subgraph would not form a cycle either.
